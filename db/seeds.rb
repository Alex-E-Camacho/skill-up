After completing this climb, I then go into a ab circuit, where I do v-ups, crunches, reverse crunches, plank, side to side plank, then hanging leg lifts to the highest elevation I can. I then do goblin swats for 3 sets with a 45 pound weight, 10 resp each set. By this time, my entire shirt is drenched with sweat.")

During the session, I start with 3 chest exercises, flat bench press, chest fly machine, then machine chest press. Afterwards I move to my back, with machine rows, lat-pull downs, and close grip rows. Then I do tricep pull downs, shoulder raises and a ab circuit. Ending with dips. I have grown from doing no dips to a max of 30 dips.")

Understanding how my body reacts to certain foods and caloric intake gave me the knowledge to draft an efficient diet that I enjoyed. As time passed and I became accustomed to by daily allowance of calories, I have now pushed myself further and became intermediate fasting. My goal is to reduce my overall body-fat percentage. Join me and become the best version of yourself.")

The best part is that it allows for muscle growth while in a caloric deficit. It is perfect for those who want to lose weight without compromising oneâ€™s strength. However, the most important thing is still sleep. No matter how many supplements you take, if you don't have healthy sleep regime your body will not be able to react to the supplements to its full potential.")
